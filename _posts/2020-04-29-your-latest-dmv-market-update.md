How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the real estate market? That’s the question I’ll answer today. Real estate has been deemed an essential service, so we’re still showing and listing homes, albeit on a virtual platform. According to the April numbers, homes are still being sold at a healthy rate.

If you have questions about our market or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don't hesitate to call or email us. We're here to help.
